          <p>
            Many disabled individuals turn to online communities when offline social spaces feel inaccessible or exhausting. While Reddit hosts numerous disability-related subreddits, little is understood about how storytelling within these spaces contributes to emotional validation, empathy, and community belonging—especially for users with rare conditions.

          <p>
          <h3>Community availability determines emotional safety</h3>
          <p>
            Participants in active subreddits described feeling less isolated and more understood. In contrast, individuals with rare conditions struggled to find engagement, leading to feelings of social disconnection despite access to informational resources.
          </p>
          <blockquote>
            “Having like, a social place that I could go to when I'm not feeling like getting up is nice to have.”
          </blockquote>
          <h3>Storytelling functions as emotional validation infrastructure</h3>
          <p>
            Personal narratives helped participants process internalized ableism, navigate decisions such as adopting mobility aids, and seek empathy through shared experience. Reading and responding to stories created a sense of collective understanding that extended beyond informational support.

           <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Active engagement mechanisms for rare-condition communities:</strong>
              Intentional moderation strategies such as recurring discussion prompts or live Q&A threads could foster sustained interaction.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Emotionally expressive feedback systems:</strong>
              Expanding beyond Reddit’s upvote/downvote system to include reactions conveying support or solidarity could better meet users’ emotional needs.
